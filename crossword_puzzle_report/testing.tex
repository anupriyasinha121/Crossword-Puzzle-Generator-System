\textbf{UNIT TESTING :}\\

Various test cases were used to test the implemented system. Different combinations of words were choosed to check the extent upto which the system can work properly and also to check the limitations.


\section{Test cases}
One of the combination of words not working for the implemented system is :\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item telnet, whatis, system, kill, tail, find, dpkg, unexpand\\ \\

\\
The reason why this test case fails is that, it contain words whose first character doesdn't matches the character of longest word placed in first row. 

\end{enumerate}
